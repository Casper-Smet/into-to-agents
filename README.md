# intro-to-agents

Assignment for the course Simulation Tooling given in the second year of the Bachelor-programme Artificial Intelligence at the HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht.

This repo contains a worked out version of the [Mesa basic tutorial](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html), with the added features of cities and Robin Hood type behaviour. See the [report](https://github.com/Casper-Smet/intro-to-agents/blob/master/intro-to-agents-and-agent-tools.pdf) for an explanation of the simulation and a recommendation on the Mesa library.


Cheers
